    <h1>Design Process and Rationale</h1>

    <h2>Design Process</h2>
    <p>
        The design process for this visualization began with identifying the key aspects of the dataset that would provide meaningful insights to users. 
        The dataset contained variables such as brand, model year, mileage, and price, which are critical factors for evaluating cars. 
        I brainstormed multiple ideas to visualize these aspects effectively, including bar charts, scatter plots, and line graphs.
    </p>
    <p>
        Initially, I sketched several designs, aiming to present the data in a way that was both visually appealing and easy to understand. 
        For instance, I considered using a scatter plot to show the relationship between mileage and price but ultimately decided on a bar chart as it provides 
        a clearer comparison of car prices across different brands.
    </p>
    <p>
        During the development phase, I implemented a dynamic filtering system. This allowed users to filter data by model year and mileage, ensuring interactivity 
        and personalization. The iterative design process involved testing various color schemes, scales, and layouts to enhance readability and accessibility.
    </p>

    <h2>Rationale of Design Choices</h2>
    <ul>
        <li><strong>Bar Chart Selection:</strong> I chose a bar chart because it provides a straightforward way to compare prices across car brands. The height of the bars intuitively conveys the differences in price.</li>
        <li><strong>Color Encoding:</strong> The bars were assigned a primary steel blue color, with a hover effect changing the color to orange. This design choice ensures visual consistency while also providing interactivity.</li>
        <li><strong>Dynamic Filters:</strong> Including filters for model year and mileage ensures the visualization is interactive and enables customized exploration.</li>
        <li><strong>Axes and Labels:</strong> The x-axis represents car brands, while the y-axis shows price. Tick marks and grid lines were added to aid precise value estimation.</li>
        <li><strong>Layout:</strong> Filters are placed above the chart to ensure they are immediately visible and accessible.</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Insights and Discoveries</h2>
    <p>
        Using the visualization, I discovered several trends in the dataset. For example, cars with lower mileage generally had higher prices. 
        Brands like Tesla and Lexus consistently appeared at the higher end of the price spectrum, indicating their premium positioning in the market. 
        On the other hand, older model years were associated with significantly lower prices, likely due to depreciation.
    </p>
    <p>
        One interesting finding was the sharp price differences within the same model year across different brands. For instance, a 2021 Audi was priced at $34,999, 
        while a 2021 Hyundai was significantly lower at $18,005. This suggests varying brand value perceptions among consumers.
    </p>
    <p>
        <strong>Note:</strong> Screenshots of the visualization support these findings and help reinforce the data-driven conclusions drawn from the analysis.
